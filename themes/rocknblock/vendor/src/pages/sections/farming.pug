                p.faq__description There are no minimum capital requirements to partake in any of these opportunities. With that being said, meaningful returns are largely earned with capital contributions starting from ~$1000 in value. You should also take into account the transaction (“gas”) costs of the strategy you wish to implement.

                p.faq__description All of these opportunities are using highly reputable DeFi products. All smart contracts have been audited which largely mitigates risk. However, with any DeFi product, there is always a very small chance of loss – meaning that no user should use more capital than they would be willing to use.
